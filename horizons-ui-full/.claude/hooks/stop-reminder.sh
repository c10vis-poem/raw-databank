# "Order of Operations" step 4 (Document): before actually ending, the State
# of the Union in CLAUDE.md should be current, updated IN PLACE — there is no
# separate per-session handoff file to also write (that convention was
# retired session 16; git history is the archive, not accumulated files).
# This does not force a git push; that stays a decision made in-conversation
# (see CLAUDE.md Hard Rules).
#
# The critical failure mode this guards against: updating CLAUDE.md's SOTU
# LOCALLY and then ending the session without committing + pushing. The next
# session reads CLAUDE.md from the remote branch (git clone/fetch), not from
# this container's filesystem — a local-only edit is invisible to it and the
# whole point of the SOTU (letting the next session pick up where this one
# left off) is defeated. Committing is not enough either; it must be PUSHED.
