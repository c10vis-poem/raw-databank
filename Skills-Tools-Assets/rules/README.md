# Rules — hard contract

Rules are the contract. **Rules > wiki guidance** when in conflict.

| Rule file | Scope |
|---|---|
| `GIT_HYGIENE.md` | Branch policy, commit safety, branch preservation |
| `AT_BAT_PROTOCOL.md` | How an agent claims, works, and hands off a milestone |
| `AAR_DECOMPILE.md` | **ARCHIVED** — Nexa-specific AAR decompile procedure, not applicable to the current QNN/Hexagon HTP stack. Kept for the reusable javap technique only. Not an active rule. |

Anthropic prompt-caching hard rules (`cache_control` mechanics — TTL,
breakpoint budget, edit cadence) moved into `CLAUDE.md`'s "Cache Prompting
+ Sub-Agent Rules" section (session 16) — no separate `CACHE_PROMPT_RULES.md`
file anymore.

## Precedence

1. Hard rules in this folder.
2. CLAUDE.md's `## State of the Union` section — the single current-state
   source, kept up to date in place. There is no separate `SOTU.md` /
   `PROMPT_PREFIX.md` / `EXECUTION_BOARD.md` / per-session handoff file in
   this repo — those names are leftovers from an earlier project structure.
3. Wiki/knowledge guidance (`wiki/*`, `knowledge/*`, including
   `knowledge/daemon-reference/GPT-DAEMON-REFERENCE.md` and
   `knowledge/daemon-reference/NPU-RUNTIME-PATHS.md`). There is no separate
   `CLAUDE_AT_HORIZONS.md` in this repo.
4. Inline comments, ad-hoc convention.

If a rule needs to change, the change goes through the operator. Don't
quietly relax a rule mid-session.
