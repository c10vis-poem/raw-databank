  Set up and troubleshoot the on-device Termux mobile dev environment — phone
  as TigerVNC + XFCE host, Samsung Tab S9 FE+ as AVNC client, plus the Matrix
  (zsh + tmux + cmatrix + Termux:Float) phone terminal. Use when a VNC
  connection from the tablet times out or is refused, when XFCE/dbus won't
  start, when stale X lock files block the server, when setting VNC geometry,
  or when configuring the Matrix waterfall split-pane look. Every step is
  sourced or trial-verified; killed guesses are recorded so they aren't
  repeated.

# Termux Mobile Dev Environment

This file is the full reference — there is no separate `wiki/Termux-VNC-Matrix-Environment.md`;
an earlier version of this skill linked to one that was never actually created.

## Topology
- **Host:** phone, Termux, no root → Xtigervnc + XFCE.
- **Client:** Samsung Tab S9 FE+, AVNC → geometry **1280×800** (half of 2560×1600).
- **Transport:** same WiFi LAN. Phone IP is **DHCP, it changes** — re-check `ifconfig`
  (`wlan0` inet) every session. `127.0.0.1` is loopback; the tablet cannot use it.
- Display `:1` = port **5901** (port = 5900 + display).

## First move on ANY connection failure: classify the error
- **Connection refused** → port closed / VNC bound to localhost.
- **Connection timed out** → packets reach nothing → still localhost-bound OR router
  **AP isolation**.

### Verification — `ss`/`netstat` DO NOT WORK on the phone
Unprivileged Termux denies netlink: `Cannot open netlink socket: Permission denied`
(and `/proc/net/tcp*` is permission-denied too). Verify via the **VNC log** instead:
```bash
cat ~/.vnc/*.log | grep -iE "listen|interface|port"
```
| Log line | Meaning | Fix |
|----------|---------|-----|
| `Listening for VNC connections on all interface(s)` | bound to LAN; phone is correct | still timing out → **AP isolation** → phone hotspot |
| `Listening ... localhost` / only `127.0.0.1` | localhost-bound | apply tigervnc.conf fix below |
| crash / no listen line | server died | read rest of log; usually dbus |

Secondary probe (also netlink-free):
```bash
pkg install netcat-openbsd
nc -vz 127.0.0.1 5901            # up?  (always works if server alive)
nc -vz <phone-wlan-ip> 5901      # bound to all interfaces? (refused = localhost-only)
```

## Make VNC listen on the LAN (persistent, documented method)
The CLI flag `-localhost no` was unreliable in trials. Use the config file:
```bash
echo '$localhost="no";' >> ~/.vnc/tigervnc.conf
echo '1;' >> ~/.vnc/tigervnc.conf
vncserver -kill :1
vncserver :1 -geometry 1280x800 -depth 24
```

## AP isolation (router blocks device-to-device WiFi)
If the log says "all interface(s)" / `nc` to the wlan IP succeeds but the tablet still
times out, the router is the blocker — not the phone. Enable the **phone hotspot**,
connect the tablet to it, point AVNC at the hotspot IP (often `192.168.43.1`). socat
fallback: `socat TCP-LISTEN:5902,bind=0.0.0.0,fork TCP:127.0.0.1:5901 &` → AVNC on 5902.

## XFCE/dbus won't start
Log shows `Failed to get a Console kit proxy` → no session dbus. xstartup must launch it:
```bash
cat > ~/.vnc/xstartup << 'EOF'
#!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash
export DISPLAY=:1
export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=$TMPDIR
dbus-daemon --session --address=$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS --nofork --nopidfile --syslog-only &
sleep 1
xfce4-session &
EOF
chmod +x ~/.vnc/xstartup
```
Package is `dbus`, **not** `dbus-x11` (that name does not exist in Termux).

## Stale lock cleanup (Termux tmp is `$PREFIX/tmp`, NOT `/tmp`)
```bash
vncserver -kill :1 2>/dev/null
pkill -9 Xvnc; pkill -9 Xtigervnc
rm -f ~/.vnc/*.pid ~/.vnc/*.log
rm -f $PREFIX/tmp/.X1-lock $PREFIX/tmp/.X11-unix/X1
```

## Killed guesses (do not repeat)
- ❌ "Android needs root to bind external ports." FALSE — Termux serves VNC to the LAN
  with no root (XDA `[NO-ROOT]` guide).
- ❌ Relying on CLI `-localhost no`. Use `tigervnc.conf` instead.
- ❌ Using `ss`/`netstat`/`/proc/net/tcp` to verify the bind. Netlink is denied on
  unprivileged Android. Use the VNC log or `nc`.
- ❌ Cleaning `/tmp`. Termux uses `$PREFIX/tmp`.

## Matrix phone terminal (the "native Android over a waterfall" look)
- Pieces: **zsh + Oh My Zsh** (the "zush"), **tmux** (split), **cmatrix** (waterfall),
  **Termux:Float** (overlay; F-Droid only, Play build won't work).
- Colors → `~/.termux/colors.properties`: bg `#0D0D0D`, fg/cursor `#00FF41`; then
  `termux-reload-settings`.
- Launcher `~/matrix-tmux.sh`: new detached session → `cmatrix -b -C green` top →
  `split-window -v -p 40` → attach. cmatrix top 60%, shell bottom 40%.
- tmux prefix on Android: `Vol-Down+B` barely registers — tap **CTR** on the keybar then
  **B**. Stop waterfall without switching panes:
  `tmux send-keys -t matrix:0.0 q ""`.
- Float attach needs `unset TMUX && tmux attach -t matrix` (else "sessions should be
  nested with care"). Float won't open → enable "Display over other apps". Resize →
  long-press, drag corners.

## Per-session checklist
1. `ifconfig` → phone `wlan0` inet (not 127.0.0.1).
2. Clean locks if restarting.
3. `vncserver :1 -geometry 1280x800 -depth 24`.
4. Verify via the **log** (not `ss`): must say "all interface(s)".
5. AVNC → `<phone-ip>:5901` + vncpasswd.
6. Timeout despite "all interface(s)" → AP isolation → hotspot or socat.

## On-device coding agents: OpenClaude + DeepSeek V4 via OpenRouter

**Two-pronged attack** — Anthropic Claude Code in the cloud (heavy reasoning) plus
**OpenClaude** on Termux (model-swappable, cheap parallel grunt work) hitting the same
GitHub repo / branch. You arbitrate merges.

### Why OpenClaude, not OpenCode
OpenClaude is the closer behavioural clone of the Anthropic Claude Code CLI — same
agentic tool-use loop, MCP-style integrations, runs native on Termux without an
Anthropic key. Claude Code for Android (the community port) is similar but locked to
Anthropic's API. Both are **non-Anthropic-proprietary** and run on Android; OpenClaude
wins on flexibility because you can point it at any model.

### Install on Termux (phone or tablet)
```bash
pkg install nodejs git
npm i -g openclaude          # or: git clone … && npm i -g .
```

### Point it at DeepSeek V4 via OpenRouter
```bash
# one-time: paste just the key at the prompt
read -s OPENROUTER_KEY
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="$OPENROUTER_KEY"

# persist for future shells
echo 'export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="<paste-in-editor>"' >> ~/.zshrc

# OpenClaude config — OpenAI-compat base URL, DeepSeek V4 model id
openclaude config set baseURL  https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
openclaude config set model    deepseek/deepseek-chat-v4
openclaude config set apiKey   "$OPENROUTER_API_KEY"
```

Then `openclaude` in the repo dir. Tool-call fidelity on DeepSeek is good but not
Anthropic-tier — give it the grunt work (refactors, doc gen, test scaffolding, lint
sweeps), keep architecture / multi-file reasoning on cloud Claude.

### Cost shape (June 2026, OpenRouter)
- DeepSeek V4: ~$0.27 / M in, ~$1.10 / M out.
- Cheap enough to run multiple parallel agents on the same branch all day.

### Killed guesses
- ❌ "DeepSeek can hit the official `claude` CLI directly." It can't — that CLI is
  hardcoded to Anthropic's `/v1/messages`. You'd need a proxy shim
  (`claude-code-router`, `anyclaude`). OpenClaude sidesteps the whole problem.
- ❌ "OpenCode = OpenClaude." Different projects. OpenClaude is the one to use here.

## Omnara (parked, not yet trialled)

YC S25 — mobile/web front-end for Claude Code. Same Anthropic Claude under the hood,
prettier UI, push notifications, multi-session management. Candidate for the next
multi-agent fan-out (cloud Claude Code + OpenClaude-on-Termux + Omnara mobile front).
Drop install + auth notes here after first run.
