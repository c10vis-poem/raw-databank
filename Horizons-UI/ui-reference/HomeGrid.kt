/* ==================================================================================
 * HomeGrid — Horizons V5 home dock.
 *
 * V5 is a SEPARATE build from V4 (branch claude/homegrid-v4-scratch, PR #30), which
 * is left untouched and still installable. Geometry, glyphs and palette trace to the
 * reference build's HomeGridSim.tsx; this revision applies the operator's on-device
 * notes taken against the V4 screenshot.
 *
 * Kept from V4 — operator: "what you did better":
 *   · the deeper black background, and the way the colours pop off it
 *   · tile card proportions and the type inside them
 *
 * Changed in V5 — the operator's punch list:
 *   · status panel shrunk hard, chat bar trimmed  -> chat bar drops down the screen
 *   · top tiles raised, bottom tiles dropped      -> gap closed, hub gets real room
 *   · header hairline pulled up
 *   · crystal enlarged, ROUTER plate tightened toward reference proportions
 *   · icons enlarged, with a real back-glow; tile borders now glow too
 *   · logo brackets no longer tower over the letters
 *   · PLASMA CORDS ARE NOW MEASURED rather than hardcoded. They attach to the real
 *     tile edges and run to the real pedestal sockets, finishing *underneath* the
 *     platform. This is the structural fix: in V4 the cords sat at fixed 400x600
 *     viewBox coordinates while the hub was laid out independently, so every
 *     spacing change desynced them. They now derive from measured layout bounds
 *     and stay attached no matter how the rest of the dock is retuned.
 *
 * Coordinate spaces still carried from the reference:
 *   star field / telemetry rings ..... 400 x 600 viewBox, stretched
 *   router crystal ................... 100 x 100 viewBox
 *   every tile glyph .................  36 x  36 viewBox
