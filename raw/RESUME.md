# AESOP — Session Resume / Handoff

Snapshot for continuing the build. Owner: c10vis-poem (nav@clovispoem.com).

## What this is
**AESOP** (Agentic Executions Split Operations Protocol) — a device-agnostic split
agent stack + personal knowledge-vault, running on Termux (Android phone) now, with
planned home nodes (Jetson Orin Nano 8GB, Rubik Pi / Dragonwing) and cloud (walled GCP,
OpenRouter GLM-5.2). Naming: **AESOP** = umbrella · **Omni-Claw** = device client
(the Novus-Agenti Kotlin app) · **Novus Agenti** = the agent protocol.

## Repos in play (all `c10vis-poem`; branch `claude/clone-wiki-obsidian-omni-6dtz7i`, except `aesop` = `main`)
- **aesop** — NEW umbrella repo. Spine pushed: `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`,
  `protocol/tiers.md`, `profiles/_example.yaml`, `profiles/nav.yaml` (his rig).
  4 subagents were writing `protocol/roles.md`, `protocol/memory.md`, `protocol/audit.md`,
  `deploy/README.md` — see below for status. **TODO: fold Graphify into `memory.md`
  as the graph-recall backend.**
- **openwiki** (fork) — target of the checkpointer PR (below). NOT started.
- **notebooklm-py, obsidian-skills, reasoning-bank, graphify, OmniRoute, claude-skills,
  tmux, termux-gui-bash, termux-packages** — all cloned in session.

## Device stack (Termux on phone) — STATUS
**DONE**
- OpenWiki = **upstream npm** `openwiki` (NOT the fork). Generates + updates the wiki
  cleanly. Output lives at `~/.openwiki/wiki`. Kill LangSmith 403 noise with:
  `export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=false; export LANGSMITH_TRACING=false; unset LANGSMITH_API_KEY`
- Vault at `~/vault`. `~/.openwiki/wiki` symlinked to `~/vault/notes/novus-agenti`
  (live, self-updating). The Novus-Agenti wiki is in the vault.
- `notebooklm-py` 0.7.3 installed (pure-python, clean). NOT logged in.

**PENDING**
- **obsidian-skills** into vault (run in a SHELL, not inside the OpenWiki TUI):
  `git clone https://github.com/c10vis-poem/obsidian-skills ~/vault/.claude/skills/obsidian-skills`
- **notebooklm auth (no browser needed at runtime):** supports `NOTEBOOKLM_AUTH_JSON`
  env var and `--storage <storage_state.json>`. No fork needed. Get the cookies ONCE via
  proot + VNC desktop (Playwright's chromium runs on glibc in the proot):
  `proot-distro login debian` → `pip install "notebooklm-py[browser]" --break-system-packages`
  → `playwright install chromium` → `notebooklm login` (sign in on the XFCE/VNC screen) →
  copy `~/.notebooklm/` into Termux home. Runs headless thereafter.
- **Graphify** — native Termux install FAILS (tree-sitter grammars won't build on
  Python 3.14 / bionic). Install in proot:
  `proot-distro login debian --bind ~/vault:/root/vault` →
  `apt install -y python3-pip pipx && pipx ensurepath && export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin` →
  `pipx install graphifyy && graphify /root/vault`
- **STT/TTS (TOP PRIORITY — "huge help right now")** — sherpa-onnx (Silero VAD +
  Moonshine STT + Kokoro TTS). `pip install sherpa-onnx` fails on Termux (no cp314 wheel;
  manylinux/glibc wheels don't load on bionic). Two routes: (1) sherpa-onnx in the Debian
  proot (glibc → wheel installs) + PulseAudio bridge for mic/speaker; (2) **prebuilt
  Android/bionic sherpa-onnx binaries in Termux + `termux-api` audio (better — audio is
  the hard part).** OPEN: what's in `~/sherpa-kok*` and `~/kokoro` — built sherpa-onnx or
  just Kokoro model files? Answer decides finish-vs-start.

## Environment gotchas (why native builds fail on Termux)
- **Python 3.14 + Node 26 are too new** → no prebuilt wheels/prebuilds → source builds →
  fail on bionic libc. Reliable native compiles belong in the **Debian proot** (glibc).
  Hit by: better-sqlite3 (openwiki), tree-sitter (graphify), onnxruntime (sherpa).
- **VNC:** avoid `:1`/5901 (phone squats it). `:2`/5902 = portrait `600x1280`;
  `:3`/5903 = landscape `1280x600`. AVNC → `127.0.0.1:590X`. xstartup must be a plain
  shell script; vncserver options as flags, never `#` comments in `~/.vnc/config`.
- **proot:** `pkg install proot-distro` FIRST, then `proot-distro login debian` (prompt
  flips to `root@`). Debian pkgs are in `main` (no universe/multiverse — that's Ubuntu).

## AESOP design (full spec in ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **4 roles:** query/tool-exec (edge), executive (home→cloud), librarian/switchboard
  (home; the flywheel write-back), auditor/red (cloud, out-of-band).
- **3 memory types:** declarative (wiki markdown = source of truth), recall (OB1/Open
  Brain, Postgres+vector+MCP), strategic (reasoning-bank). **Graphify = 4th index:
  graph-recall.** Markdown canonical; all indexes derived/rebuildable.
- **Flywheel:** OpenWiki writes → notebooklm feeds → obsidian-skills operate → graphify
  indexes → all over one `~/vault`. Librarian distills learnings back through the audit
  gate → markdown → re-index.
- **Audit gate:** Tier0 read (free) · Tier1 reversible (self-audit) · Tier2
  irreversible/memory-commit (independent audit; edge → queue for reconnect).
- **reasoning-bank:** auditor = the autoeval judge; executor emits trajectory
  `{query,think_list,action_list}`, auditor-blind; verdict→reward→distilled strategy.
  Retrieval read-free (Tier0); distillation write-gated (Tier2). Swap
  `gemini-embedding-001` → local embedder for max-privacy.
- **Tiers:** edge/personal/home/cloud = capability classes (not devices); roles bind with
  fallback; profiles map hardware. `profiles/nav.yaml` = his 4-tier rig.
- **Omni-Claw WebView OAuth** = the device-native login (Android WebView + CookieManager →
  storage_state) for notebooklm/Claude/Gemini — one auth mechanism.
- **OmniRoute = the gateway** binding role→runtime per profile (was under-specified in
  earlier passes; expanding here). It is NOT just "a router" — it already has the
  infrastructure this design needs, reused rather than rebuilt:
  - **Combo routing** (`open-sse/services/combo.ts`, 14 strategies incl. priority,
    weighted, cost-optimized, context-optimized) is the literal mechanism for "bind role
    X to runtime Y, fall back to Z" — AESOP's tier fallback chains map directly onto
    combo-routing targets, no new routing logic needed.
  - **`src/lib/memory/`** (FTS5 + Qdrant) is an existing memory subsystem — candidate to
    host Recall (replacing/alongside OB1) rather than standing up a second vector store.
  - **Provider circuit breaker / connection cooldown / model lockout** (3-layer
    resilience, see OmniRoute's own `docs/architecture/RESILIENCE_GUIDE.md`) is exactly
    the "tier absent → fall back" behavior AESOP needs, already implemented and battle
    tested — do not reinvent, wire AESOP's tiers into it.
  - **`mcp_audit` table + MCP server** (`open-sse/mcp-server/`) is a natural home for the
    audit gate's write-envelope/verdict log (§5 in ARCHITECTURE.md) — every Tier-1/2
    action already has an audit-log table shape to reuse.
  - **The red/auditor as a hub endpoint**: register the cloud GLM-5.2 auditor as an
    OmniRoute target like any other model — "there but not there" (routable, zero local
    footprint). This is how independence + reachability are both satisfied at once.
  - TODO next session: write this up properly as `aesop/protocol/gateway.md` (mirroring
    roles.md/memory.md/audit.md) instead of leaving OmniRoute as a one-line mapping.

## Open decisions
- Auditor: in-stack-isolated vs strictly out-of-band (leaning cloud GLM-5.2).
- OpenWiki PR: MemorySaver fallback (safe, mergeable) vs node:sqlite saver (better,
  untestable in the cloud container).
- Recall + Strategic share one vector backend (namespaces) or stay separate?
- Home executive binds to Jetson vs phone Qwen (per profile).

## Immediate next actions
1. Commit any subagent-produced `aesop/protocol/*.md` + `deploy/README.md` (check
   `/workspace/aesop`); fold Graphify into `memory.md`.
2. Device: clone obsidian-skills into vault; do the notebooklm proot+VNC login.
3. **STT/TTS**: confirm contents of `~/sherpa-kok*` / `~/kokoro`, then install sherpa-onnx
   (proot or Android binaries) and wire `termux-api` audio.
4. OpenWiki fork: make the fallback checkpointer patch → open draft PR upstream (then
   `npm update -g openwiki` on device inherits the fix).

## STT/TTS — findings (this session, low battery, capturing for next)

**Confirmed via device screenshots — do NOT re-ask, just execute below.**

- `~/storage/.../sherpa-kokoro/kokoro-multi-lang-v1.x/` = REAL correct Kokoro bundle:
  `model.onnx` (326MB) + `espeak-ng-data/` + `dict/` + `lexicon-us/gb/zh` + `date-zh.fst`.
  This is exactly sherpa-onnx's expected OfflineTts file layout. Nothing wrong with it.
- `kokoro_tts.py` = a hand-rolled bypass calling onnxruntime directly with a DIY
  phonemizer. **BROKEN**: its char-by-char loop (`for p in ipa: if p in phoneme_map`)
  can never match its own multi-char map entries (`aɪ`, `eɪ`, `dʒ`, etc — IPA diphthongs
  are 2 chars, loop reads 1 at a time). Do not debug/fix this file — replace with real
  sherpa-onnx, which phonemizes correctly using the bundle's own espeak-ng-data/lexicons.
- `voice_bot.py` = STUBBED. `run_tts()` doesn't call kokoro_tts.py at all — it shells
  `ffmpeg` to generate a fake 440Hz sine beep as a placeholder. `run_stt()` is referenced
  but not implemented/shown. Whole voice loop is currently non-functional scaffolding.

**Verdict:** no sherpa-onnx runtime installed anywhere. Model assets are correct and
ready. Next session: install real sherpa-onnx and point it at the existing bundle;
throw away kokoro_tts.py's phonemizer and voice_bot.py's stub once sherpa-onnx works.

**Install path (Python 3.14 on Termux has no prebuilt sherpa-onnx wheel — same class of
problem as better-sqlite3/tree-sitter). Two options, try in order:**

1. Termux native, but pin an older Python sherpa-onnx actually ships wheels for:
   `pkg install python3.11` (if packaged) or check `pip index versions sherpa-onnx`
   for a cp313/aarch64 match first — do NOT assume, check before installing.
2. Reliable fallback — Debian proot (glibc, matches sherpa-onnx's manylinux wheels):
   ```
   proot-distro login debian --bind ~/storage/shared:/root/storage
   apt install -y python3-pip
   pip install sherpa-onnx --break-system-packages
   ```
   Then point it at the existing bundle path (mounted via --bind, no need to redownload):
   `model=/root/storage/.../kokoro-multi-lang-v1.x/model.onnx`,
   `voices=.../voices.bin` (confirm exact voices file name — user mentioned finding a
   "voices" file, likely `voices.bin` per sherpa-onnx's kokoro convention, not the
   `voices.json` the broken script expects).
   Audio I/O bridge (mic/speaker Termux<->proot) still TODO — likely PulseAudio.

**Immediate next step for next session:** get sherpa-onnx's official Kokoro Python
example running against `kokoro-multi-lang-v1.x/model.onnx` in the proot, confirm real
audio out, THEN wire it back into voice_bot.py replacing the sine-beep stub.

## STT/TTS — model choice + install plan (decided, new session)

- **STT model: `csukuangfj/sherpa-onnx-moonshine-base-en-int8`** (chosen over tiny for
  quality; both are the only two Moonshine variants in the official sherpa-onnx HF org).
- **Runtime vs model separation (answers "can one install persist everywhere"):**
  model files (Moonshine, Kokoro, Silero VAD) are ABI-agnostic data — ONE shared folder
  (e.g. `~/models/`) works across every environment via symlink/bind-mount, no duplication.
  The sherpa-onnx RUNTIME cannot be shared as one binary: Termux = bionic libc, Debian
  proot = glibc, different ABIs. Checked sherpa-onnx's Android release assets directly —
  they are JNI `.so` libs for embedding in an APK, NOT standalone CLI binaries, so there is
  no bionic-native shortcut. Confirmed plan: ONE shared model folder + a thin sherpa-onnx
  RUNTIME install inside the Debian proot (glibc matches its prebuilt wheels, straightforward
  pip install). Remaining known task: bridge mic/speaker from Android into the proot
  (PulseAudio, point proot's PULSE_SERVER at Termux's audio).
- GitHub API/web access to k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx is BLOCKED at this environment's proxy
  (repo out of session scope) — don't burn time re-trying github.com/api.github.com for
  this repo; use WebSearch or HF tools instead.

## STT/TTS — voice engine COMPLETE (this session)

**All three speech layers verified working in the Debian proot:**

| Layer | Model | Test Result |
|---|---|---|
| **TTS** | Kokoro multi-lang v1.0 | 4.75s audio generated from text — SUCCESS |
| **STT** | Moonshine base-en-int8 | Transcribed both TTS output and bundled test WAV — SUCCESS |
| **VAD** | Silero VAD v5 | Detected 1 speech segment (0.17s–4.74s) — SUCCESS |
| **Round-trip** | TTS→STT self-test | voice_loop.py --demo: generated speech, transcribed it back — SUCCESS |

**Files created (untracked, ready to commit):**
- `voice-engine/scripts/tts_test.py` — Kokoro TTS via sherpa-onnx
- `voice-engine/scripts/stt_test.py` — Moonshine STT via sherpa-onnx
- `voice-engine/scripts/vad_test.py` — Silero VAD via sherpa-onnx
- `voice-engine/scripts/voice_loop.py` — Full VAD→STT→TTS pipeline with self-test demo
- `voice-engine/README.md` — Architecture and usage docs
- `voice-engine/SETUP.md` — Step-by-step install guide
- `voice-engine/.env.example` — Environment variable template

**Key API notes (sherpa-onnx 1.13.4):**
- `VadModelConfig` + `VoiceActivityDetector(config)` — `accept_waveform(samples)` takes ONLY samples (no sample_rate arg; SR set in config.sample_rate)
- `OfflineRecognizer.from_moonshine(preprocessor, encoder, uncached_decoder, cached_decoder, tokens, num_threads, decoding_method)`
- `OfflineTtsConfig` with `OfflineTtsKokoroModelConfig(model, voices, tokens, data_dir, lexicon, length_scale)`
- STT auto-resamples 24kHz→16kHz internally (sherpa-onnx handles it)

**Novus-Agenti independence — CONFIRMED:**
- Novus-Agenti git: clean, no changes, up to date with origin/main
- Its speech stack is entirely Kotlin/native-Android:
  - `SherpaOnnxTtsClient.kt` — Kokoro TTS via JNI sherpa-onnx Android bindings
  - `SileroVadDetector.kt` — Silero VAD v4 via onnxruntime-android (bundled in assets)
  - `VoiceLoopController.kt` — mic→VAD→Qwen3.5-9B→TTS with barge-in support
- When you download the Novus-Agenti UI, it plugs in and runs with its own TTS/STT layer
  regardless of what AESOP builds. The two share model *files* (data) but not code, runtime,
  or process space.

**Remaining for full live mic/speaker:**
- PulseAudio bridge from Android to the proot (file-based mode works now)
- OR wire `termux-microphone-record` + `termux-media-player` for file-based audio I/O

## T3 Infrastructure Bring-Up — 2026-07-17 session

### Lane: AESOP infrastructure only. Novus-Agenti NOT touched.

### Repos cloned this session (~/repos/)
All 11 repos from c10vis-poem org cloned: aesop, Novus-Agenti, reasoning-bank,
OB1, graphify, obsidian-skills, notebooklm-py, OmniRoute, silero-vad, aider,
openwiki-fork. All on main (graphify on v8, silero-vad on master).

### Tailscale (T1 — phone)
- **NOT installed.** No Tailscale binary, Android app, or VPN interface detected.
  - `which tailscale` = empty
  - `pm list packages | grep tail` = empty
  - `ifconfig` shows only wlan1 (10.0.0.62) and rmnet_data2 (192.0.0.8)
  - No 100.x.y.z address, no tailscale0 interface
- **Action needed (user, 10 min):** Install Tailscale Android APK from Play Store
  or F-Droid. Log in, note the phone's 100.x.y.z tailnet IP. Enable MagicDNS in
  admin console. Termux traffic rides the VPN tunnel automatically — no Termux
  pkg/pip install needed.

### Deploy files created (aesop/deploy/)
All files committed to the aesop repo working tree (untracked, ready for commit
to main, docs-only per constraints):

```
deploy/
  README.md                    ← T3 architecture diagram + bring-up order + memory budget
  jetson/
    FLASHING.md                ← JetPack 6.x flashing guide, firmware check, troubleshooting
    first-boot-setup.sh        ← One-shot: apt, Tailscale, Docker, clone repos, gen secrets, vault sync
    vault-sync-setup.sh        ← Bare git repo + mirror + cron for phone→Jetson vault push
    docker-compose.yml         ← Postgres+pgvector (:5432), Redis, OmniRoute (:20128, :20129)
    .env.example               ← Secrets template (POSTGRES_PASSWORD, JWT_SECRET, API_KEY_SECRET)
  rubik-pi/
    SETUP.md                   ← Qualcomm flashing, sherpa-onnx install, shared models, TTS systemd service
  init/
    ob1-schema.sql             ← OB1 thoughts table + strategies table + audit_log table + pgvector HNSW indexes
```

### Design decisions
1. **Postgres self-hosted, not Supabase.** OB1's docs use Supabase cloud; for T3
   we self-host the same schema (pgvector/pgvector:pg16 image). Same table shape
   (thoughts with vector(1536), HNSW index, metadata GIN index), plus a
   strategies table for ReasoningBank and an audit_log table for the AESOP
   audit gate (§5).
2. **OmniRoute runner-base profile.** No Chromium/Playwright (saves ~300MB).
   The Jetson is a hub, not a web-cookie provider node. Can upgrade to runner-web
   later if web-cookie providers are needed.
3. **Memory budget: 512MB Postgres + 96MB Redis + 1280MB OmniRoute = ~1.9GB
   for containers.** Leaves ~5GB for OS + future executive-small (gemma-4-E2B ONNX).
4. **Vault sync = bare git repo + cron mirror.** Phone pushes to Jetson's
   ~/vault.git; Jetson pulls to ~/vault-mirror every 30 min for backup.
   No Syncthing (simpler, git-native, matches the "markdown is canonical" principle).
5. **Rubik Pi TTS = systemd service.** sherpa-onnx should install directly on
   aarch64 glibc (unlike Termux/bionic). Shared ~/models/ folder, same model
   bundles as the phone's proot setup.

### What was NOT done (needs physical hardware)
- Jetson is not present — cannot flash, boot, or start containers. All deploy
  files are ready for the operator to run on the actual hardware.
- Rubik Pi is not present — same.
- Tailscale requires the Android APK install (user action, not automatable from
  Termux).

### Next session actions
1. **User: install Tailscale Android APK**, note phone's tailnet IP.
2. **User: procure Jetson Orin Nano Super 8GB + 256GB microSD (A2 U3).**
3. **Flash Jetson** per `deploy/jetson/FLASHING.md` — check firmware first.
4. **Run first-boot-setup.sh on Jetson** — Tailscale, Docker, secrets, repos.
5. **docker compose --profile t3 up -d** — verify 3 containers healthy.
6. **Verify from phone over Tailscale** — psql, OmniRoute dashboard, vault push.
7. **Procure + flash Rubik Pi** per `deploy/rubik-pi/SETUP.md` — after Jetson stable.
8. **Commit deploy/ to aesop main** — these are docs/scripts only, main branch,
   no secrets in files (.env.example has placeholders only).
