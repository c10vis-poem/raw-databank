# AESOP Architecture

**Agentic Executions Split Operations Protocol**

AESOP is a protocol for a split, multi-node agent stack with one shared, auditable
memory. It is defined in terms of **roles**, **memory types**, and **capability tiers**
— never specific hardware. A user's actual machines are declared in a *profile*
(`profiles/`), which maps hardware onto tiers. This separation is what makes AESOP
publishable: the protocol is device-agnostic; only the profile is personal.

---

## 1. Design principles

1. **Roles are fixed; runtimes are swappable.** An agent is defined by its *role*, not
   the box it runs on. The gateway binds role → runtime per profile and per context.
2. **Markdown is canonical; indexes are derived.** The wiki (markdown) is the single
   source of truth — git-versioned, diffable, human-reviewable. Vector stores (recall,
   strategic) are rebuildable indexes over it and never a competing truth.
3. **Audit lives on the write boundary, not on every thought.** Reads and reasoning run
   free. Only side-effecting actions pass the gate.
4. **Graceful tier degradation.** A missing tier's roles fall back to the next tier in
   the chain. Phone + laptop + cloud must run the whole system; a home node just makes
   it better.
5. **The auditor is independent by construction.** It never shares context or state with
   the executor it judges — so it cannot be co-opted by the same failure, nor gamed.

## 2. Node tiers (reference)

Tiers are **capability classes**, not devices. A node may span tiers; a tier may be
absent (degrade) or backed by multiple boxes.

| Tier | Class | Default role tenancy | Must provide |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **T1 — Edge / Mobile** | always-on-person, sensors, constrained, intermittent | query/tool-exec + client UI (Omni-Claw) | local small model *or* passthrough; camera/mic; offline action queue |
| **T2 — Personal / Workstation** | laptop/desktop, CPU-class (± modest GPU), present when working | interactive executive, dev tools, heavier query | user terminal/browser; more compute |
| **T3 — Home Node / Hub** | always-on home box | **memory** (wiki + recall + strategic), gateway/router, librarian, local executive, TTS/audio | persistent storage; always reachable over LAN/Tailscale |
| **T4 — Cloud** | elastic + off-site | heavy training (ReasoningBank induction / MaTTS), out-of-band auditor, canonical backup | on-demand compute; durable storage; passthrough models |

**Composition rules**
- A role declares a **preferred tier** + an ordered **fallback chain**.
- If a tier is absent, its roles collapse onto the next reachable tier in the chain.
- Two boxes may back one tier (e.g. a compute box + a desktop box both serving T3).
- One box may serve several tiers (e.g. a laptop serving T2 and standing in for T3).
- The number and layout of tiers is a **profile** decision; the four above are a
  reference template, not a constraint.

## 3. Agent roles and binding

| Role | Responsibility | Preferred → fallback |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Query / tool-exec** | Turns your input into meta-prompts; calls tools; reads memory; runs a self-recursive plan→act→observe loop. Reliable at narrow, structured work. | T1 → T2 |
| **Executive** | Heavy reasoning with direct file/memory access. | T3 → T4 → T2 |
| **Librarian / switchboard** | Intercepts prompts and outputs; selects which memory to surface; logs sessions; distills learnings and **commits them back** to the wiki (the flywheel). | T3 → T4 |
| **Auditor (red)** | Independent gate on side-effecting actions; judges trajectories pass/fail; that verdict is ReasoningBank's training signal. | T4 (out-of-band) |

Binding is a profile concern. Example: away (only T1 reachable) → query+exec collapse
onto the phone; executive heavy-lift defers to T4; auditor defers/queues. Home (T1–T4
reachable) → each role lands on its preferred tier.

## 4. Memory architecture

Three **distinct** memory types — the separation is the point.

| Memory | Kind | Content | Backend |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Declarative** | authored | facts, docs, "what things are" — **source of truth** | wiki markdown (OpenWiki generates; Obsidian / Graphify render) |
| **Recall** | emergent | raw thoughts, sources, cross-domain search | OB1 / Open Brain (Postgres + vector, MCP-exposed) |
| **Strategic** | distilled | reasoning patterns from successes **and** failures | ReasoningBank (`{query, think, action, status}` → distilled item + embedding) |

**Shared tooling & interchange**
- **notebooklm-py** is a shared *source/synthesis tool* any memory may call (grounded
  Q&A, summaries, podcast/quiz artifacts). Auth is a Google session, not a Gemini API key.
- **Markdown** is the interchange format across all three; embeddings are derived.
- Recall and Strategic are both vector stores and **may share one backend** (e.g. OB1's
  Postgres with a `thoughts` namespace and a `strategies` namespace).

### The flywheel (closed loop)

```
OpenWiki writes repo docs → wiki (markdown, canonical)
        ↑                          ↓
   audited write-back        OB1 / ReasoningBank index it
        ↑                          ↓
   Librarian distills ← agents use it (query · executive)
```

Learnings re-enter the same wiki that serves Obsidian, Graphify, OpenWiki, and the
vector indexes. The loop **amplifies whatever it circulates**, which is why the write
path is gated (§5).

---

## 5. The audit gate

Audit is a **policy on the write boundary**, not a per-inference check. The
files-executor performs the write; the auditor approves it. They are the *write* and
*approve* halves of one gate and never talk directly.

| Tier | Action | Audit behavior (edge / away) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **0** | read, reason, info tool-call | none — free recursive loop |
| **1** | reversible local write | self-audit pass (same model, adversarial prompt); logged |
| **2** | irreversible / outbound (email, calendar, spend, **memory commit**) | independent audit required → cloud auditor if reachable; else **queue for audit-on-reconnect** or hard-confirm |

Flywheel write-backs into the wiki are **Tier 2** by definition, so memory is never
mutated by an unaudited inference — it waits. On the edge this gives a self-recursive,
independently tool-calling agent for Tier 0–1, with teeth kept only where a mistake costs.

---

## 6. ReasoningBank integration (the auditor's memory)

ReasoningBank (Google Cloud AI; arxiv 2509.25140) distills reusable strategies from
**both** successful and failed trajectories, retrieves them before acting, and feeds new
learnings back. Its mechanism maps 1:1 onto AESOP's decoupled executor/auditor:

| AESOP | ReasoningBank |
| --- | --- |
| Files-executor (auditor-blind) | emits `{query, think_list, action_list}` — never calls a judge |
| **Auditor** | the `--judge autoeval` reward source; pass/flag → `reward` 1/0 |
| Shared protocol | the trajectory record + memory-item schema; executor and auditor meet only here |
| Self-improving loop | labeled trajectory → `induce_memory` distills strategy → retrieved before next act |

- **Retrieval reads free (Tier 0)** — even offline, the edge model is smarter from past
  lessons.
- **Distillation writes through the gate (Tier 2)** — a new strategy is minted only after
  a verdict, so the strategy bank can't be poisoned by an unaudited run.
- **Privacy note:** the reference impl embeds with Google `gemini-embedding-001` (cloud).
  The on-device / max-privacy tier **must** swap this for a local embedder.

## 7. Profiles & privacy tiers

Two axes select bindings: **reachability** (which tiers are up) × **privacy tier**.

| Privacy tier | Executive binds to | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Convenience | browser session / cloud model | hub hosts only librarian + gateway + memory |
| Hybrid | local terminal + cloud model | + routing/caching |
| Max privacy (closed loop) | on-device local model + local embedder | nothing leaves the perimeter |
| Walled training | enterprise cloud (e.g. GCP) | recursive JSONL / ReasoningBank induction inside a security boundary |

See `profiles/` for concrete hardware mappings.

## 8. Component mapping (reference implementations)

| Module | Fills | Repo |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Declarative memory (generation) | wiki docs from repos | OpenWiki |
| Declarative memory (render/graph) | vault + graph views | obsidian-skills (kepano), Graphify |
| Recall memory | vector + MCP memory | OB1 / Open Brain |
| Strategic memory | strategy distillation | reasoning-bank |
| Source/synthesis tool | grounded Q&A, artifacts | notebooklm-py |
| Gateway / router / "there-but-not-there" | role→runtime binding, passthrough, caching, audit logging | OmniRoute |
| On-device client (Omni-Claw) | UI + sensors + cloud connectors | Novus-Agenti |
| Skill/agent library | cs-* agents, red-team/adversarial-reviewer skills | claude-skills |

---

## 9. Open questions

- Auditor deployment: co-deployed-but-isolated vs strictly out-of-band. Leaning
  out-of-band (cloud GLM 5.2), which also satisfies independence for free.
- Whether Recall and Strategic share one vector backend or stay separate stores.
- Local embedder choice for the max-privacy tier.
